Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project required a 12 and 24 hr clock to be displayed at the same time. 
What did you do particularly well?
I was able to form the menu of the clock and make it somewhat functional. When a menu option was pressed, the time would change and update, but it would update on a completely new and separate clock which was not what was supposed to happen. The menu options were supposed to update the time on the originally printed clock. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
To enhance my code I would definitely change the menu function to allow the clock to properly update. I would also go through each line to make sure it is updated to be efficient and effective in what I am trying to achieve. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Making the layout of the enclosed clock was tedious and challenging. Being able to produce the exact amount of * needed to close the clock and the menu was difficult. I managed to overcome this by going into zybooks, and asking the tutors questions. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Being about to code a menu is a very valuable, and basic skill that can be used in many future assignments. A menu is needed for most any user operated device, and being able to create a functioning menu will come in handy in future projects. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Following syntax rules make the code readable, and allowing space in between lines of code allow the project to be readable and adaptable rather than being overwhelming upon first glance. Starting slowly, and understanding what is required of you and knowing how to code in an orderly fashion helps to maintain the integrity of the code without finding yourself in an error ridden mess of a project because it was writted quickly and without strategic reasoning.
